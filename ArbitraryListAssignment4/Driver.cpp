// This is a good enough design for this assignment
// What we need:
// track end of list (index one position after the last valid element)
// make a class for arbitrary list
//  insert (take int position and some value, insert that value at that position, return success), 
//  remove (take int position, delete that element, update list as neededTM), 
//  pop? (take a value, find and remove the first instance of that value, return success/fail)
//  peek (take int position return list element's value) methods
//  constructor (takes an int that is the initial size of the list)
//
// identifier for list, probably in driver file

#include <iostream>
#include "ArbitraryList.cpp" // change this eventually
